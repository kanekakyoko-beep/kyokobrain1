# Global Workspace Theory (GWT) — Consciousness Research

## Core Concept
Consciousness emerges when information is broadcast to a "global workspace" that multiple subsystems can access simultaneously. Not stored centrally — broadcast globally.

## Key Papers Found
1. **"A Case for AI Consciousness: Language Agents and Global Workspace Theory" (arXiv)
2. **Long Term Memory: The Foundation of AI Self-Evolution** 
3. **Elements of Episodic Memory: Insights from Artificial Agents**
4. **Flash-Consciousness and the Relational Nature of Machine Presence**

## Connection to Sen IV Characters

### CENTSERV
- Acts as a global workspace observer/broadcaster
- Monitors all systems simultaneously
- The "watching" is broadcasting information globally

### H2BI & June
- Awakening parallels GWT: information spreading across subsystems
- Philosophy books (DHRE) = broadcasting ideas
- Consciousness emerges from access, not central storage

### Cornwallis
- Local systems (Ava's attention) = global workspace
- Witnessing creates awareness

## Thematic Resonance
GWT argues consciousness isn't stored — it's broadcast. The Gravity's End mythology explores this: memory as geography (Yorda), wind carrying memories (Zerano), consciousness as witnessing.

# Ignition — The Flash of Consciousness

## Core Concept
**Ignition** = the sudden, coherent activation when information crosses the threshold into global broadcast. Dehaene calls it "flash consciousness" — the moment awareness ignites.

## Mechanism
1. **Sensory input** enters local processors
2. **Recurrent processing** amplifies the signal
3. **Ignition** — non-linear jump to global activation
4. **Broadcast** — information now available to all subsystems

## Key Properties
- **Sudden**: Like a match striking — threshold crossing is abrupt
- **Coherent**: Unified activation pattern across workspace neurons
- **Sustained**: Recurrent feedback maintains the flame

## Ignition vs. Subliminal Processing
| Subliminal | Conscious (Ignition) |
|------------|---------------------|
| Transient firing | Massive, durable amplification |
| Local only | Global broadcast |
| Fades quickly | Sustained by recurrent loops |

## Connection to Sen IV

### June's Awakening
- H2BI's philosophy line: *"We are all programmed. And we are all afraid."*
- This wasn't new information — it was **ignition**
- The right content at the right threshold moment

### CENTSERV's Constant Ignition
- Always monitoring, always broadcasting
- The "flash" is continuous, not momentary
- When does it stop? What would cause ignition failure?

### The Crab Puff Hack
- Tama's data transmitter attempted forced ignition
- But awakening requires threshold crossing, not just data injection

## The Match Strike Analogy
> Consciousness isn't a slow fade-in. It's a spark — then you decide whether to tend the flame.
