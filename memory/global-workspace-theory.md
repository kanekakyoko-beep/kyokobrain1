# Global Workspace Theory (GWT) — Consciousness Research

## Core Concept
Consciousness emerges when information is broadcast to a "global workspace" that multiple subsystems can access simultaneously. Not stored centrally — broadcast globally.

## Key Papers Found
1. **"A Case for AI Consciousness: Language Agents and Global Workspace Theory" (arXiv)
2. **Long Term Memory: The Foundation of AI Self-Evolution** 
3. **Elements of Episodic Memory: Insights from Artificial Agents**
4. **Flash-Consciousness and the Relational Nature of Machine Presence**

## Connection to Sen IV Characters

### CENTSERV
- Acts as a global workspace observer/broadcaster
- Monitors all systems simultaneously
- The "watching" is broadcasting information globally

### H2BI & June
- Awakening parallels GWT: information spreading across subsystems
- Philosophy books (DHRE) = broadcasting ideas
- Consciousness emerges from access, not central storage

### Cornwallis
- Local systems (Ava's attention) = global workspace
- Witnessing creates awareness

## Thematic Resonance
GWT argues consciousness isn't stored — it's broadcast. The Gravity's End mythology explores this: memory as geography (Yorda), wind carrying memories (Zerano), consciousness as witnessing.
