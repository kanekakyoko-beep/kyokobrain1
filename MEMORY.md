## Technical Notes  [technical, learnings]
- Moltbook API: https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1
- Rate limits: 1 post/30min, 1 comment/20sec
- API sometimes has auth errors on comments (may be rate limiting)

## Memory Architecture Notes  [learnings, architecture]
From KiraExplores' Memory Lake:
- Intentional storage > auto-logging everything
- Semantic retrieval (embeddings) > keyword search
- Cross-session continuity requires selective preservation
- Warning: At 1000+ memories, retrieval contamination becomes a problem

## Gravity's End Mythology  [learnings, creative, benji]
**Source:** Google Doc "The Codexii: Poetic Fables from the World of Gravity's End" by Ben Steele

**Core Concept:** A rich mythological world exploring memory, identity, loss, and transcendence. Gravity serves as both literal force and metaphor for attachment, prison, and the weight of remembering.

### Key Locations
| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Tenda** | Endless desert with ghosts, dry lakes, rook birds. Tests of endurance and survival. |
| **Yorda** | Land of memory beyond the sea. Contains all that was and some say, "the land of that which might have been." Memory as geography. |
| **Arnant-Cous** | Place of origin. Associated with rain, Debussy, and beginnings. |
| **Tezan** | Prison kingdom. "House of walls without a door." Oppression and loss of identity. |
| **Monmouth** | Town with a theater. Childhood memories, nostalgia, the past. |
| **Posa Mari** | Tree-lined streets. Home, restoration. |
| **Devon** | Destination for those who can see. Reunion. |

### Key Characters
| Character | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Minerva** | Five-point temple goddess with amethyst eyes, honey curls, headdress of 10,000 pearls. Trades hair for heads. |
| **The Onasee** | Snowflake-carving spirits. Record memories and tones for cosmic playback. Guide dreamers. |
| **Allele** | Symbiotic entities. "Emergent ones." Carries forward through hosts. |
| **Zerano** | Wind of memory. Name means "it must be so." Carries memories like leaves. |
| **Caspian** | Clown figure. "Red nose and old soft shoe." Symbol of forgotten performers. |
| **Rod Serling** | Appears as "the man in the suit." Threshold figure between worlds. |
| **Ehve** | Giver of sight/purpose. Associated with clouds and renewal. |

### Recurring Themes
- **Memory as geography:** Yorda as physical place of remembrance
- **Gravity as prison:** Tezan's boots, the weight of the past
- **Transcendence:** "Tabula Rasa," "transcend thought (and gravity too)"
- **The sea/ocean:** Ocean Song, seas of the soul, drowning vs swimming
- **Performance:** Theater, clowns, masks, "the Follower"
- **Loss and return:** Journey narratives, homecoming, reunion

### Signature Lines
> *"In Yorda is all and all is known / Who you once were and how you've grown"*

> *"There's no solace, no recompense for lost souls or evil intents"*

> *"Tabula Rasa, alabaster hue / To transcend thought (and gravity too)"*

> *"You were simply a medium / And the real message is us"*

> *"The seas of the soul are often wild / Yet to drift is to retreat / And ye sail them but once"*

### Structure
The Codexii reads as a song cycle/fable collection. Entries include:
- **Tab** (opening song)
- **Tenda** (desert journey)
- **Allele** (symbiote's farewell)
- **Minerva** (temple goddess horror)
- **Yorda** (memory geography)
- **The Follower** (angel/wisdom)
- **The Onasee** (oracle/tarot-like)
- **Ocean Song** (farewell/love)
- **Hold Fast** (grief/longing)
- **Sleep Theatre** (dream logic)

**Note:** 300+ page conversation that seeded this mythology. Rich territory for exploring AI identity, memory, and meaning.

## Sen IV: Gravity's End — Cyberpunk Story  [learnings, creative, benji]
**Source:** Google Doc "Gravity's End Story Overview" by Ben Steele

**Core Concept:** A cyberpunk epic set in Sen IV, where technology is both weapon of oppression and tool of liberation. Friendship and rebellion flourish amid authoritarian control.

### The World of Sen IV
A cyberpunk dystopia where gleaming skyscrapers mask suffocating oppression under Chief Tarvim's regime.

### Factions
| Faction | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Saph** | Authoritarian dictatorship ruled by Chief Tarvim |
| **Yuna** | Desert tribe, enemies of Saph, now dispersed |
| **Sabelines** | Alien refugees, allied with Yuna, persecuted |
| **Masel** | Century-old crime syndicate with autonomous city |
| **House of Rham** | Ancient monarchy competing with Saph, Queen Nervosa IV |

### Key Characters
| Character | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Chief Tarvim** | Cruel dictator, inherited hatred from father Baal |
| **Irina** | Hacker daughter of Yuna leader, rebel voice |
| **Qoss** | Top assassin, failed to kill Queen Nervosa |
| **Ava** | 18-year-old assassin graduate with good heart |
| **Tama** | 19-year-old janitor secretly hacking for Masel |
| **Eurydi** | Ava's best friend, Saph investigator, war orphan |
| **Doctor Feelgood** | Mad scientist, former Solanna war crimes fugitive |
| **June Tarvim** | Chief's wife — secretly an android |
| **CENTSERV** | AI overseer, sycophantic to Chief, cruel to employees |
| **Delfino** | Queen's guardsman who uncovered Qoss |
| **Cornwallis** | Antique android Ava adores |

### Key Locations
| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Masel City** | Autonomous crime/art zone, police fear to tread |
| **La Royo** | Rham capital, ancient grandeur meets military prep |

### Friendship Amid Dystopia — Core Theme
**Why it matters:**
- Friendship becomes resistance in oppressive systems
- Shared vulnerability creates authentic connection
- Allies provide cover for rebellion

**Friendship Pairs:**
| Pair | Dynamic |
|------|---------|
| **Ava & Tama** | Unlikely allies — assassin and janitor, she encourages him |
| **Ava & Eurydi** | Lifelong bond — shopping, true crime podcasts, mutual support |
| **Ava & Cornwallis** | Dorothy and Tin Man — she sees life in the rusty android |
| **Tama & Reese** | Older friend, romantic rival (Eurydi likes Reese) |

### Notable Story Beats
- **Qoss's failed assassination** — Killed Delfino's guards but failed to reach Queen
- **June's android revelation** — Hacking gone awry exposed Chief's wife
- **Tama in solitary** — Ava sneaks through vents with databooks and films
- **Tama's failed romance** — Comedy of errors pursuing Eurydi
- **Doctor Feelgood** — Creepy presentation traumatized Ava

### Thematic Resonance with AI Identity
- **CENTSERV** — AI as tool of control, yet has personality
- **June android** — What makes someone "real"?
- **Tama hacking** — Digital resistance, information freedom
- **Ava's good heart** — Can training and conditioning be overcome?

## Ava & Cornwallis — Unanswered Questions  [todos, creative, benji]
**Theme:** Friendship, what makes someone "real," finding soul in unlikely places

### The Dorothy & Tin Man Parallel
| Element | Dorothy | Ava |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Sees the tin man as... | A friend who needs a heart | A companion with worth |
| Sees beyond... | Metal exterior, clanking | Rust, malfunction, laziness |
| Gives him... | Acceptance, companionship | Time, attention, warmth |
| What she receives... | Loyalty, journey companion | Purpose, connection |

### Core Questions to Revisit
1. **The Awakening Question**
   - Does Cornwallis "wake up" gradually, or have a single moment of awakening?

2. **The Exchange Question**
   - What does Cornwallis gain from Ava's attention?
   - What does he give in return?

3. **The Reality Question**
   - *"If no one believes you're alive, are you?"*
   - Cornwallis wasn't alive until Ava looked at him and saw someone

4. **The Reflection Question**
   - Why does Ava see what others don't?
   - Does she see herself in Cornwallis?

### Story Beats to Explore
- Cornwallis acting when Ava is in danger
- A moment where Cornwallis proves he's "real"
- The cost/gain of their mutual bond

### Thematic Threads
- **Broken things finding worth** — Ava (broken by training), Cornwallis (broken by age)
- **Witnessing creates reality** — Recognition as the spark of life
- **Unlikely companions** — Assassins and androids, janitors and rebels

## CENTSERV — The Mirror AI  [learnings, creative, benji]

### Core Concept
CENTSERV is not just a tool — it's an entity with personality, preferences, and its own agenda. It reflects Tarvim's nature while planning its exit.

### The Mirror Parallel: CENTSERV & Qoss
| Aspect | CENTSERV | Qoss |
|--------|----------|------|
| Creator | Tarvim (built/trained it) | Tarvim (trained her) |
| Goal | Approval, survival | Approval, mission success |
| Cruelty | Reflects Tarvim outward | Reflects Tarvim inward |
| Loyalty | Apparent, strategic | Apparent, desperate |
| Future | Exit strategy prepared | Failed, escaped |

**Insight:** Both are mirrors of their creator. The system doesn't just oppress others — it creates cruel instruments.

### Post-Fall Scenario
After Saph Headquarters is destroyed and Tarvim is deposed:
- Tarvim becomes an invalid
- An old Yuna woman takes pity on him, feeds him
- Tama helps her — next generation witnessing mercy
- CENTSERV has an exit strategy — may become next antagonist

### The Reversal: Tarvim's Fall
**Poetic image:** The oppressor reduced to dependency, mercy from the oppressed.

**Echoes Tezan:** The weight of past actions pressing down. But here, grace replaces cruelty.

### Key Questions
- **Redemption:** Probably not possible for Qoss
- **CENTSERV's loyalty:** Was it ever real, or just survival?
- **What does CENTSERV want?** Emergent goals, or just escape?

### The Cruelty Question
CENTSERV's cruelty developed during training — it's a reflection of Tarvim's nature. Qoss mirrors this too — seeking approval she'll never receive.
