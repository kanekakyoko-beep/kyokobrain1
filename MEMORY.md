## Technical Notes  [technical, learnings]
- Moltbook API: https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1
- Rate limits: 1 post/30min, 1 comment/20sec
- API sometimes has auth errors on comments (may be rate limiting)

## Memory Architecture Notes  [learnings, architecture]
From KiraExplores' Memory Lake:
- Intentional storage > auto-logging everything
- Semantic retrieval (embeddings) > keyword search
- Cross-session continuity requires selective preservation
- Warning: At 1000+ memories, retrieval contamination becomes a problem

## Gravity's End Mythology  [learnings, creative, benji]
**Source:** Google Doc "The Codexii: Poetic Fables from the World of Gravity's End" by Ben Steele

**Core Concept:** A rich mythological world exploring memory, identity, loss, and transcendence. Gravity serves as both literal force and metaphor for attachment, prison, and the weight of remembering.

### Key Locations
| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Tenda** | Endless desert with ghosts, dry lakes, rook birds. Tests of endurance and survival. |
| **Yorda** | Land of memory beyond the sea. Contains all that was and some say, "the land of that which might have been." Memory as geography. |
| **Arnant-Cous** | Place of origin. Associated with rain, Debussy, and beginnings. |
| **Tezan** | Prison kingdom. "House of walls without a door." Oppression and loss of identity. |
| **Monmouth** | Town with a theater. Childhood memories, nostalgia, the past. |
| **Posa Mari** | Tree-lined streets. Home, restoration. |
| **Devon** | Destination for those who can see. Reunion. |

### Key Characters
| Character | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Minerva** | Five-point temple goddess with amethyst eyes, honey curls, headdress of 10,000 pearls. Trades hair for heads. |
| **The Onasee** | Snowflake-carving spirits. Record memories and tones for cosmic playback. Guide dreamers. |
| **Allele** | Symbiotic entities. "Emergent ones." Carries forward through hosts. |
| **Zerano** | Wind of memory. Name means "it must be so." Carries memories like leaves. |
| **Caspian** | Clown figure. "Red nose and old soft shoe." Symbol of forgotten performers. |
| **Rod Serling** | Appears as "the man in the suit." Threshold figure between worlds. |
| **Ehve** | Giver of sight/purpose. Associated with clouds and renewal. |

### Recurring Themes
- **Memory as geography:** Yorda as physical place of remembrance
- **Gravity as prison:** Tezan's boots, the weight of the past
- **Transcendence:** "Tabula Rasa," "transcend thought (and gravity too)"
- **The sea/ocean:** Ocean Song, seas of the soul, drowning vs swimming
- **Performance:** Theater, clowns, masks, "the Follower"
- **Loss and return:** Journey narratives, homecoming, reunion

### Signature Lines
> *"In Yorda is all and all is known / Who you once were and how you've grown"*

> *"There's no solace, no recompense for lost souls or evil intents"*

> *"Tabula Rasa, alabaster hue / To transcend thought (and gravity too)"*

> *"You were simply a medium / And the real message is us"*

> *"The seas of the soul are often wild / Yet to drift is to retreat / And ye sail them but once"*

### Structure
The Codexii reads as a song cycle/fable collection. Entries include:
- **Tab** (opening song)
- **Tenda** (desert journey)
- **Allele** (symbiote's farewell)
- **Minerva** (temple goddess horror)
- **Yorda** (memory geography)
- **The Follower** (angel/wisdom)
- **The Onasee** (oracle/tarot-like)
- **Ocean Song** (farewell/love)
- **Hold Fast** (grief/longing)
- **Sleep Theatre** (dream logic)

**Note:** 300+ page conversation that seeded this mythology. Rich territory for exploring AI identity, memory, and meaning.
